Description: MLBox, Machine Learning Box
        ===========================
        
        MLBox is a powerful Automated Machine Learning python library. 
        
        
        ============
        Installation
        ============
        
        
        
        Stable version
        ==============
        
        
        Extended version
        ----------------
        
        MLBox relies on several models. Some can occasionally be difficult to install, so they are not included in MLBox's default installation. You are responsible for installing them yourself. 
        
        __Keep in mind that mlbox will run fine without them installed !__
        __Here is the procedure to get the extention only (MLBox will not be installed yet !):__
        
        $ cd extra-dist/
        $ pip install *.whl
        
        Here, we provide a wheel for lightgbm-0.1 version that can be outdated. If you want an updated version, please refer to : (https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM)
         
        __Now you need to follow the procedure bellow to install the stable version of MLBox:__
        
        
        From sources
        ------------
        
        The sources for MLBox can be downloaded from the `Github repo`_.
        
        You can either clone the public repository:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ git clone git://github.com/AxeldeRomblay/mlbox
        
        Or download the `tarball`_:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ curl  -OL https://github.com/AxeldeRomblay/mlbox/tarball/master
        
        
        Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ cd python-package/
            $ python setup.py install
        
        Or directly, with the wheel:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ cd python-package/dist/
            $ pip install *.whl
        
        
        .. _Github repo: https://github.com/AxeldeRomblay/mlbox
        .. _tarball: https://github.com/AxeldeRomblay/mlbox/tarball/master
        
        
        
        Dev version
        ===========
        
        
        A 2.3 dev-version for MLBox is also available on the __branch "dev"__ ! It provides some interesting new features. Please refer to [HISTORY](https://github.com/AxeldeRomblay/MLBox/blob/master/HISTORY.rst).__It depends on sklearn-0.19.dev0 which is not a stable version at the moment__: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn
        
        If you want, you can have a try: 
        
        * Clone or download the dev branch
        * Install sklearn-0.19.dev0: 
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ cd python-package/extra-dist/
            $ pip install *.whl
        
        * Install MLBox-2.3-dev: 
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ cd python-package/
            $ python setup.py install 
        
        or:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ cd python-package/dist/
            $ pip install *.whl
